## Running
Run `npm install` to install all dependencies, then run `npm start` to build and launch the React application locally.<br> Navigate to http://localhost:3000/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Tests
Run `npm run cy:test` to run the Cypress E2E test files. These should all pass if your solution has been implemented correctly.
